# Getting Started

### Reference Documentation

This Hotel Reservations API was created by using spring 3.2.3.
Notes about the application:
* In could be easily integrated with MySQL as RDBMS by only uncommenting some lines on the application.properties file.
* I followed the Domain Driven Design methodology to name the classes and packages.
* The Hotel Reservations API is made of CRUD methods (Created, Read, Update and Delete).
* The app also has /reserve endpoint which is the main part of the assignment. It internally validated the roomNumber and dates given as parameters.
* The app once this gets run, it automatically creates 3 records on the DB. The information was given properly on the ReservationGenerator.java class file.
* In case of questions, please let me know and we can coordinate a Zoom quick call.
